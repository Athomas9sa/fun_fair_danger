        Welcome to Room 3. 

        Yes, I know, a troll blocking the doorway.

        He won't move an inch, as if the Queen of England's Beefeaters.

        Try him, sneeze, laugh, have a pretend heart attacked!

        Only advise, don't touch him, he can be a bit cranky!

        Well, what are you waiting for, go on in!
